#Fun With Monads

running "npm run watch" watches for change and creates the browser bundle "build.js"
"npm run build" can be used to update "build.js".

"app/index.html" contains two scripts. On top is "monad.js" and next is "build.js" In the browser, the console log gives access to some ready-made monad instances and a number of functions, including all of the functions used in this project. It is a good place to experiment with the monads. The code is running online at http://schalk.net:4001 .

An explanation of why I call instances of Monad and MonadIter "monads" is in the application commentary, and also in the commentary at https://github.com/dschalk/javascript-monads running online at http://transcendent.ninja .
